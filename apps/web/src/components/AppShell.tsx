 * A floating panel that can play an exit. While `closing` it is `inert` —
 * gone as far as input goes — and it gives up focus on the commit that
 * starts the exit. Inert alone is not enough: the browser only moves focus
 * out of an inert subtree at its next rendering update, so a key pressed
 * straight after the Escape that closed the inspector still landed in the
 * inspector's field, typing a shortcut into a form on its way out instead of
 * reaching the workspace. Focus goes to the body, where an unmount would
 * have left it.
