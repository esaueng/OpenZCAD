/**
 * What the viewport shows for a feature picked in History.
 *
 * A feature whose own body is still on screen selects that body — except a
 * fillet or chamfer, which lights the blend faces it made, so its edge set
 * reads on the part instead of the whole body tinting. A feature
 * a later one consumed (a Boss unioned into the bracket) used to select
 * every body downstream of it, so the whole part lit up and the callout
 * named the part rather than the feature. Now the faces that came from the
 * feature light up instead, traced back through the lineage every face
 * carries (see {@link faceLineageTrace}), and when none survived (a later
 * cut took them all) the consumed body is drawn as a ghost where it was.
 * Only when neither exists does the old downstream selection remain, so a
 * row never selects nothing.
