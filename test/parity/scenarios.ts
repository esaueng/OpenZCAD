 * Known kernel defects, keyed by scenario (currently none pinned as build

 * made the scenario build — but note its baseline faceCount (~2789) is the
 * mesh-fallback signature: the analytic cut still fails and the mesh-boolean
 * fallback carries the demo. The underlying unify-then-cut defect remains
 * tracked in brepkit; when it is fixed the flange faceCount should collapse
 * to tens of faces and the baseline must be rerecorded.
 *
 * KNOWN RED: that fallback mesh is not watertight — the flange body reports
 * ~873 boundary edges, unchanged from kernel 2.128.5 through 2.129.0, so
 * `produces watertight, manifold body meshes` and `exports a watertight STL`
 * both fail for flange, and are expected to until the analytic cut lands.
 * Every other scenario passes (22 of 24). These two are deliberately left
 * failing rather than pinned: unlike a build failure there is no expectation
 * mechanism for them, and suppressing a watertightness assertion is the kind
 * of green-looking blindfold this harness exists to prevent.
